# Project-Calculator-2

A second attempt in building a calculator app after two years and this time **it was successful**! Looks like my time in dabbling with python is not a waste of time after all. <br> <br>I'm very happy in finishing this one as this is the last project of foundations. *Hope I can continue doing web development as a hobby more*.
